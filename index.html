       <h3>The Social Footprint</h3>
       <h4><span>We work with the aim of making our
           children socially responsible citizens.</span></h4>
       <p>We are taking responsibility for their education as well as
           their upbringing. Our tutors work with over 500 children
           EVERYDAY to offer them a holistic learning experience. It
           is crucial to bridge the gap between the learning they
           deserve and the learning they get.</p>
